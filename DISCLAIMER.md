# Legal Framework & Disclaimers

## CYBERSECURITY WARNING & USER RESPONSIBILITY
**By deploying Wolfclaw or using its binary distributions (.exe, .deb, .msi), you explicitly acknowledge and agree to the following:**

1.  **High-Risk Execution Intelligence**: Wolfclaw is an autonomous agentic framework capable of executing low-level terminal commands, modifying system registries (in Windows Legacy builds), and managing network traffic. If misconfigured or used without oversight, it poses a **significant cybersecurity threat** to your host machine and network.
2.  **Binary Integrity**: While official builds are provided for convenience (.exe for Windows, .deb for Linux), the act of running autonomous agents with system-level access is inherently dangerous. You assume full responsibility for the integrity of your environment.
3.  **Command Authorization**: You are **solely and exclusively responsible** for the actions taken by agents. The "Digital Soul" configuration grants the AI the power to interact with your OS; you must audit all agent behaviors.
4.  **No Guarantee of Accuracy**: AI-generated logic is non-deterministic. The developers do not guarantee that agent actions will be safe, predictable, or error-free.

## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
**IN NO EVENT SHALL THE DEVELOPERS , CONTRIBUTORS, OR AFFILIATED PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER** (including, without limitation, direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages; loss of data, profits, or business interruption) arising out of the use of or inability to use this software, even if advised of the possibility of such damage. This software is provided **"AS IS"** and any express or implied warranties are disclaimed.
