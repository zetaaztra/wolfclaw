### What is Wolfclaw?
Wolfclaw is like a **smart brain** that lives inside your computer. It’s a box of private AI helpers (we call them "Agents") that can do your work for you without anyone else seeing your secrets.

## Why should I use it?

1.  **It’s Private**: Unlike ChatGPT where your data goes to a big company, Wolfclaw keeps everything on **your** computer. Your files and ideas stay yours.
2.  **It’s Smart**: It remembers how you like things done. The more you use it, the better it gets at helping you.
3.  **It’s and Easy Dashboard**: You don't need to be a computer expert. We have a beautiful screen (GUI) where you can just point and click to tell your helpers what to do.
4.  **No Monthly Fees**: If you have a good computer, you can run it for free forever. No more "Pro" subscriptions!

## What can my helpers do?
*   **Write for you**: Emails, stories, or school work.
*   **Search for you**: Read documents and find the answers you need fast.
*   **Watch & Learn**: You can show a helper how you do a task (like filling a form), and it can learn to do it for you next time.
*   **Always Ready**: Your helpers are ready to work 24/7 on your PC.
