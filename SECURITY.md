## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Wolfclaw is a tool with high system-level access.** We take security reports seriously.

If you discover a security vulnerability within Wolfclaw, please do **not** open a public issue. Instead, follow these steps:

1.  **Draft a Detailed Report**: Include the nature of the vulnerability, a proof-of-concept (if possible), and the potential impact.
2.  **Submit via Secure Channel**: Email the lead developer (Pravin A Mathew) at a secure address or use the project's encrypted gateway if available.
3.  **Wait for Response**: We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix.

### Scope
- Core LLM Routing logic.
- Session Management & Authenticaton.
- Workspace Isolation/Docker execution.
- Path sanitization.

### Out of Scope
- Third-party LLM provider vulnerabilities (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
- Misconfiguration of local hardware/OS by the user.

## Responsible Disclosure
We ask that you observe "Responsible Disclosure" practices—giving the development team reasonable time to address the issue before making it public.
